	          <div class="pb-md-5">
							<p>As we know that a salon is a great necessity for both genders and we do a lot of things there ranging from something as small as shaping your brows to getting a haircut, styling your hair in various ways. As people we get busy and to go the salon and wait long until your turn comes is a lot of work and a waste of time. With the trying times that we are currently facing as the world with COVID-19 as our "new norm" we need to have a few human interactions. Also, there is a gap with knowing what exactly to do when you get to the salon because most of salons do not have platforms where they showcase their work so that they can attract more customers and for them to know what they will do when they get to the salon and the price that they are willing to pay for the service that they want.

Carrying cash is also a big problem because of safety reasons and for people who will be doing your hair because a person might get a service they want and end up not paying so to have a platform where they can pay prior and online would be satisfactory. The Lira's salon aims to simplify this process by integrating all the processes involved in going to the beauty salons and going through a lot of trouble by providing the app site that will showcase the different stylists which work at the salon and as a client you can choose wich stylist you want to go to with taking into considerations about the work that each stylist does ranging from barbers, nail techs and hair stylists. Also the site can provide all the work that they do so that the clients can see and select what they would want to do when they get to the salon and the price they willing to pay for the service. A client can pay online before going to the salon. Also, a booking system will be there , and you can pick a slot as a client to when you would like to go to the salon and clashes will be shown if the stylist has accepted a booking for that time and you will have to resort to booking a different time. For people who have been visiting the same client or salon more often will get cheaper bargains like discounts. Also with the system you can know which stylist specializes in which type of hair and have been doing so for years, so for every stylist there will be all the information about them and the work they have done over the years.
